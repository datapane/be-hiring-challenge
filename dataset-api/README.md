## Usage

docker-compose up

The above command will start an API server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/datasets/.

The API server has a single root endpoint, /dataset/,
that allows list and CRUD operations over a dataset object via the following API / HTTP verbs:

- GET /datasets/ - list the uploaded datasets
  POST /datasets/ - creates a dataset. This endpoint takes a CSV file as input,
  and stores it the server as a pandas dataframe.
  A reference to this created object is returned by the endpoint, for instance an id or url.

- GET /datasets/<id>/ - return the file name, and size of the dataset object

- DELETE /datasets/<id>/ - delete the dataset object

- GET /datasets/<id>/excel/ - export the dataset as an excel file

- GET /datasets/<id>/stats/ - return the the stats generated by running df.describe()
  on the pandas dataframe as a json object

- GET /datasets/<id>/plot/ - generate and return a PDF containing a list of histograms of all the numerical columns in the dataset
